Decimal to Binary Converter

Overview
This project is a Decimal to Binary Converter built using JavaScript.
 It demonstrates the concept of recursion, where a function calls itself to break down complex problems into simpler sub-problems.
 You will also explore the call stack and visualize the recursion process through animations.

Features
Decimal to Binary Conversion: Enter any decimal number, and the app will convert it into its binary representation.
Recursion in Action:

 The core logic of the conversion is implemented using recursion, 
providing a practical example of breaking down tasks into smaller problems.

Visual Animation: A visual representation of the recursive process through animation, 
making the recursion easier to understand.

Key Concepts Covered

Recursion: Learn how functions can call themselves to solve smaller instances of the same problem.

Call Stack: Explore how the call stack is built and unwound during recursive function execution.

JavaScript Functions: Understand how functions work with recursive calls and base cases.

Technologies Used
HTML: For the layout of the application.
CSS: For styling and animation effects.
JavaScript: For the logic behind the decimal to binary conversion and handling the recursion.

How to Run
Clone the repository.
Open index.html in your browser to start converting decimal numbers to binary.
Watch the animation to see recursion in action!
